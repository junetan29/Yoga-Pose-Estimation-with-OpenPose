2. Download Openpose from the link https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/archive/refs/tags/v1.7.0.zip
3. Unzip the file, and create a new folder ‘build’ in the source root directory. This folder is used to store the files generated by compilation
4. Download other zip files for the following task. The links of the zip files are given below.

   caffe - https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/caffe/tree/b5ede488952e40861e84e51a9f9fd8fe2395cc8a
   
   pybind11 - https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/tree/085a29436a8c472caaaf7157aa644b571079bcaa
5. Unzip files and store them in ‘3rdparty\caffe’ and ‘3rdparty\pybind11’
6. Open CMake-gui, fill in the source code location and the location of the compiled files, which is the 'build' directory just created above
